# JS-Calculator

## Description
This is a simple calculator. I built this calculator using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was a fairly straight-forward project, though  I did have an issue getting the operators to function properly. But once I sorted it out, it works pretty well!

## Usage
In order to use the calculator, you can pull up the webpage: https://drewrvaz.github.io/JS-Calculator/. Once there, you use it as you would a normal calculator! Choose your first number, they will display in the top screen. Then select the operator that you want to use. Select the number you would like to perform the action with. And then hit the equal button and it will calculate the answer for you! This calculator only does the four base operations.
